Trend analysis for emissions

# DATA SOURCES

## Resource Watch - GHG emissions by country and sector
WRI (2022) downscaled sector level x country GHG emissions
Jayachandran (2023) current emissions by sector in regions grouped by income 



# Methods
for WRI data cleaning:
(1) match to region (SSA, EU, etc) - online source TBD
(2) match to income class - WB
(3) match to poverty rates - WB
(4) match countries to energy access statistics - online source TBD 
(5) match to population estimates - online source TBD 

for analysis:
(1) create visual of trend
(2) run quick reg (control for region/pop) to see if there's an emissions <> energy access relationship
(3) look up papers charting this - EKC is part of this literature 
(4) create graphics of regional emissions (historical) by sector x region
